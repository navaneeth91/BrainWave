## About

BrainWave is a full-stack e-learning platform built to let instructors upload course material (videos, PDFs, links), create quizzes, and manage learners. Students can register, enroll in courses, complete quizzes, monitor their progress, and download/receive certificates upon completion.

## Features

* Role-based access (Teacher / Student)
* User registration & authentication
* Instructor dashboard: upload lectures, create quizzes, manage courses
* Student dashboard: view courses, attempt quizzes, track progress
* Certificate generation for completed courses
* Profile management (including profile photo)
* Basic analytics / progress indicators

## Tech & Architecture

* **Client**: JavaScript (React) — Single Page Application (client/)
* **Server**: Node.js + Express — REST API (server/)
* **Storage**: (configurable) — examples: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* **File storage**: local or cloud (Cloudinary / S3) for assets & certificates
* **Deployment**: Backend may be deployed on Vercel (or any Node host) and client on Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages

> *Note*: I generated this README using your repository structure (client/ and server/) as the source. Update the database/service names below to match your server's actual implementation.

## Repository Structure

```
BrainWave/
├─ client/           # React frontend
├─ server/           # Node/Express backend
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

## Getting Started (local)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm or yarn
* (Optional) MongoDB or other DB if your server uses one

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navaneeth91/BrainWave.git
cd BrainWave
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` folder (example keys below):

```
PORT=5000
# If using MongoDB
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/brainwave
# JWT secret (if using JWT)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# Cloudinary / S3 keys (if you upload images/files)
CLOUDINARY_URL=...
# Email config for sending certificates/notifications (optional)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_USER=you@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=secret
```

Client environment (optional): create `.env` in `client/` with:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

> Replace the variable names above with whatever your server expects (check `server/package.json` / server code for exact names).

## Run

### Development

```bash
# Terminal 1 - run backend
cd server
npm run dev   # or `npm start` depending on package.json

# Terminal 2 - run frontend
cd client
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` for the client and `http://localhost:5000` for the API (or whatever ports you configured).

### Production / Build

```bash
cd client
npm run build
# Serve build with your choice of static host or integrate into server
```

## API (example endpoints)

> These are example/commonly expected endpoints for an e-learning app. Adjust to match `server/` implementation.

* `POST /api/auth/register` — register new user
* `POST /api/auth/login` — login (returns token)
* `GET /api/users/me` — current user profile
* `POST /api/courses` — create a course (teacher)
* `GET /api/courses` — list courses
* `GET /api/courses/:id` — course details & lectures
* `POST /api/lectures` — upload lecture content (file/video)
* `POST /api/quizzes` — create quiz
* `POST /api/quizzes/:id/submit` — submit answers
* `GET /api/certificates/:userId` — get user certificate

## Screenshots

Add screenshots in `docs/` or `client/public/screenshots/` and reference them here for a nicer README.

## Roadmap / Future work

* Add OAuth (Google/Facebook) login
* Improved certificate templates & PDF generation
* Video streaming & chunked uploads
* Mobile-friendly responsive UI
* Gamification (badges, leaderboards)

* make a shorter `README` for internship submissions, or
* update this file to include exact environment variable names and DB details if you paste `server/.env.example` or `server/package.json` here.
